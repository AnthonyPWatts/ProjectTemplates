# Better project templates

Leaning heavily on a [Microsoft Visual Studio channel post on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDNcxU0_OuE&ab_channel=MicrosoftVisualStudio).

Only one template, but it's published and working on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AnthonyPWatts.Templates.MVC). ASP.NET MVC Core 3.1 Web App with Swagger already wired up and Serilog hooked up at Program.cs level, pulling config from appsettings, and logging to Console, File and Seq when DEV.
